        <pre>I'm sitting here cold as ice
Swallow my friend's advice
Praying it'll bring you back to me
Designed through radio static
I start hearing your voice reply
Almost like you're right here with me

So don't tell me when it's over
I don't wanna know
I'm done carrying the weight of the world
So heavy on my shoulders
I just wanna feel this love
Even if it's only when I'm tripping I see your face
I ain't doing no one a favour while I'm sober
For the moment I can only hope this lasts
Coz when the high stops then I know that you're gone

So stay and hold me like a paper weight
Kiss me like it's all the same
Just lovers like we were supposed to be
Oh as these shapes and colours all start to fade
I can feel you slipping away
Just promise that you'll wait right here for me

Until I find another dose
Won't make it on my own
I'm done carrying the weight of the world
So heavy on my shoulders
I just wanna feel this love
Even if it's only when I'm tripping I see your face
I ain't doing no one a favour while I'm sober
For the moment I can only hope this lasts
Coz when the high stops then I know that you're gone

When the high stops then I know that you're gone

So don't tell me when it's over
I don't wanna know
I'm done carrying the weight of the world
So heavy on my shoulders
I just wanna feel this love
Even if it's only when I'm tripping I see your face
I ain't doing no one a favour while I'm sober
For the moment I can only hope this lasts
Coz when the high stops then I know that you're gone
